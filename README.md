# TooltipDataInspector

There's a lot of information hidden away in the data structure returned from the C_TooltipInfo functions, but it's a pain to dig into it. This displays all that data for you in a nicely formatted manner.

## Usage

Type `/tdi` or click the icon in the addon compartment. The inspector that appears will show data from whatever tooltips you trigger.
